#### 4. 🎟️ Timings, Entry Fees & Ticketing
- **General Timings**: Most public monuments, parks, and museums operate from **sunrise to sunset** (approx. 9:00 AM – 5:30 PM).
- **Weekly Closures**: Check official tourism portals in advance as many regional museums or heritage complexes close on Mondays or Fridays.
